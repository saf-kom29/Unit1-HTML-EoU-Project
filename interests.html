            <h2>My Interests & Hobbies</h2>
            <p>I have many hobbies that are independent of computer science and coding-- interests that help me stay
                motivated, balanced, and content with myself. Here's a list of a few!</p>

            <h3>Drawing/Sketching</h3>
            <img src="flower.jpg" alt="a sketch of flowers" width="250">
            <p>Whenever I feel like it, I always love sitting down with a pencil and a sketchbook and doodling small
                things. Usually, I focus on characters from various animated media and OCs (Original Characters). It
                helps me feel happy and productive, and allows me to channel creativity and imagination in my usually
                logic-based life.</p>

            <b>A list of the things I draw the most:</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Flowers and plants:</b> usually roses, dahlias, mushroom variaties, and lotuses.</li>
                <li><b>Characters from other media:</b> I'm flexible and often try to be diverse with this, but my top
                    favorites to draw are characters from Sonic the Hedgehog, JJK, and TADC.</li>
                <li><b>Original Characters:</b> Not much explanation needed. I really like creating new characters and
                    drawing them as much as I can. That's where the creativity comes from.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>What I like about drawing:</i> Creative outlet, very abstract and imaginative, requires thinking and
                strong visualizing skills.</p>

            <h3>Writing</h3>
            <img src="https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/518/208/original/man-working-with-computer-bright-colorful-vector-illustration.jpg"
                alt="clipart of man typing on computer" width="300">
            <p>Writing has always been a source of comfort and inspiration for me. Much like drawing, I enjoy writing
                because I love telling my own stories and it allows my imagination to run free.</p>
            <p><b>Genres I enjoy writing:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Psychological Horror</li>
                <li>Sci-Fi</li>
                <li>Fantasy</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Personally, I think writing is essential to me succeeding in multiple fields, as I find it the most
                accessible and easiest form of media for me to express myself in. Writing can also develop critical
                thinking and planning skills, as to compose a story you have to account for multiple aspects of your
                characters, settings, etc.</p>

            <h3>Gaming</h3>

                alt="the game Terraria's main logo & picture" width="256">
            <img src="modern-gaming-monitor_195186-4747.jpg" alt="clipart of modern gaming monitor" width="300">
            <p>As you can tell by the pictures, I also like playing various video games during my free time (although
                nowadays, not very often). It's an easy stress-reliever and provides multiple unique experiences when
                playing the right games.</p>
            <p>A few of my favorites are, but are not limited to:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Terraria:</b> an immersive 2D sandbox game where you can craft thousands of weapons, build unique
                    architecture, and house NPCS.</li>
                <li><b>Undertale:</b> a 2D RPG game, one that teaches you the values of kindness, determination, and the
                    consequences of your actions.</li>
                <li><b>Sonic the Hedgehog:</b> although the STH franchise is expansive and not limited to one game, I
                    enjoy the timing-based platforming experience Sonic games bring.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I enjoy gaming because of the thousands of different experiences they bring, the unpredictability of new
                games, and the development of cognative and finger reflexes.</p>

            <h2>How all My Hobbbies Connect to CS</h2>
            <p>In general, it's important to have a diverse palette of hobbies and talents, but you should have a main
                focus point that most (if not all) of your hobbies tie back to. For me, gaming inspired me to find out
                how all of the encoded mechanics and sprites work and what makes them behave the way they do. Writing
                and drawing helped me discover the creativity to use my developing coding skills to create new things
                and find inspiration in others' work.
